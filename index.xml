      <description>Introduction This is my first blog post on Octopus&amp;rsquo; garden. In this one, I will write about the Moebius Strip. I found a nice article on it a long time ago by Gideon Schwartz called The Dark Side of the Moebius Strip. I thought I might write about that. This blog post is just an introduction to the mathematics of moebius strips. The accepted Spellings are Möbius or Moebius. I will be using Moebius rather than Möbius as I do not want to copy the umlaut everytime I write Möbius.</description>

      <description>Hello people. I am InvisibleFoe, a physics major at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata. Currently I am interested in Stochastic thermodynamics and its assosciated stuff. I also like math.&#xA;I made this website because I wanted to learn HuGo. After doing that, the website lay dormant for a year because I was too lazy to even write anything for it.So now in an effort to actually do something about this website, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about posting blogs about random stuff I find cool.</description>

      <description>I am Sabarno Saha, a student at IISER-Kolkata studying anything and everything I like. I like Physics and Maths. When I am not studying, which is often, I like quizzing, watching TV Shows and watching Sebastian Lague or Nerdstalgic on YouTube.&#xA;I like coding sometimes. My computer runs Fedora with Hyprland. I used to use Arch before, but I could not handle a distro that randomly breaks on my laptop when I try to do actual work, and then I have to try to fix for multiple hours where you go through a ton of forums and finally, when nothing works, do a fresh install of Arch.</description>
