      <description>Introduction This is technically my first blog post containing actual material here. I gave a presentation for the Maths Club at my University. The slides for which were made in LaTeX using beamer and can be found here, on my GitHub. I just converted the latex document to markdown using Pandoc and after some minor tweaks, I have posted it here. The blog aims to demonstrate how to deal with statistically large systems(systems with a large number of degrees of freedom) and the conditions under which they might attain equilibrium.</description>

      <description>I listen to music now and then and then some more. Now and then I get stuck into a vicious listening cycle, where I listen to same songs over and over again. In an attempt to increase and diversify my music tastes, I have been listening to a new album every week and Iâ€™ll try to jot down my feelings here.&#xA;Pop and rock have always been my go-to genres, mostly leaning towards rock.</description>

      <description>I am Sabarno Saha, a student at IISER-Kolkata studying anything and everything I like. I like Physics and Maths. When I am not studying, which is often, I like quizzing, watching TV Shows and watching Sebastian Lague or Nerdstalgic on YouTube.&#xA;I like coding sometimes. My computer runs Fedora with Hyprland. I used to use Arch before, but I could not handle a distro that randomly breaks on my laptop when I try to do actual work(which is not often).</description>
