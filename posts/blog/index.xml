            <description>Hello people. I am InvisibleFoe, a physics major at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata. Currently I am interested in Stochastic thermodynamics and its assosciated stuff. I also like math.
I made this website because I wanted to learn HuGo. After doing that, the website lay dormant for a year because I was too lazy to even write anything for it.So now in an effort to actually do something about this website, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about posting blogs about random stuff I find cool.</description>

<p>I made this website because I wanted to learn HuGo. After doing that, the website lay dormant for a year because I was too lazy to even write anything for it.So now in an effort to actually do something about this website, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about posting blogs about
random stuff I find cool. Also, I need to improve my writing skills because they are currently abysmal and resembles how a preteen might write their essay for an exam.  I might also write some
album reviews in a different page, but I am lazy. Finally, welcome to the Octopus Garden and it&rsquo;s horrendously written blogs.
This is a list of the stuff I have written till now.(I will hyperlink them later).</p>
